# CSS Grid

Hello! This repo is for tracking and documenting the lessons from Wes Bos's CSS Grid course. I plan to also include summaries of lessons learned after each topic.

## Lesson 3 - CSS Grid Fundamentals

- when you make a grid container, all of its direct children become grid items *automatically*
- but nothing is "sliced and diced" into columns and rows yet, because we still have to define them with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows
- you can define grids with px, em, rem, %, auto, and a new unit fr 
- grid-gap adds spacing in-between the columns and rows
